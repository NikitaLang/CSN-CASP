Constructing Social Networks in the Context of Automated Spear-Phishing

Public social networking services such as Facebook,
Twitter, and LinkedIn all have the possibility to leak
both implicit and explicit social cues. These social
cues can form the basis for social engineering attacks
in which perpetrators investigate and later deceive
victims to obtain targeted information. This type of
attack focuses on human vulnerabilities which can
lead to the perpetrator bypassing a number of soft-
ware security barriers. Spear-phishing attacks often
involve significantly more effort on the part of perpe-
trators, as exchanges require an intricate understand-
ing of the social network of victims. This is often only
available through the connection and authorization
of that connection by the victim in a social network-
ing service. However, recently, web scrapers have
leaked a dataset containing profile data for over 90%
of LinkedInâ€™s 740M users [9], lowering the barrier
of entry for this type of attack.
